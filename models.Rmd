## Libraries
```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#If you have never used R or tidyverse before make sure to install the package before loading the libraries
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
```

## Loading the data

```{r load}

atp_w49<- read_sav("ATP W49.sav")
atp_w49

```

## Models

```{r model1}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
